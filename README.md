# Capstone Project

## About

I want to iterate on my music appreciation website from the beginning of the course and flesh it out into reviews on bands and albums, as well as make buttons with embedded videos of the bands I talk about.

## Built with
* HTML
* CSS
* JS
* Bootstrap
  
## Roadmap
- [X] Remake music website from CSS week
- [X] Touch it up with Bootstrap and more pages
- [X] Research putting video embeds into elements
- [X] Put videos into button popovers

## Wireframe
I do not use Wireframes, my brain and logic is wired differently and I have no use for them nor want to make them. I cannot draw due to hand disabilities and I do not feel comfortable with Canva and its creators. I use other methods of Pseudocode to realize and visualize my ideas and problems that work much better for me throughout the length of this course.
